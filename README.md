# Face Recognition with OpenCV and Face_Recognition Library

This project implements real-time face recognition using OpenCV for capturing video frames and the `face_recognition` library for face detection and recognition.

## Features

- **Real-time Face Recognition:** Captures frames from the camera and checks if the face matches a predefined reference image.
- **Multithreading:** Uses a separate thread for face recognition to ensure smooth and non-blocking video capture.
- **Visual Feedback:** Displays "Face Match" or "Face Not Match" on the video feed based on whether a face matches the reference image.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- OpenCV
- face_recognition
- numpy

## Installation

1. **Install required libraries:**

   ```bash
   pip install opencv-python face-recognition numpy
2. Install tenserflow cc and framework :
   '''bash
   cd scripts
   chmod +x largefile_download.sh
   ./largefile_download.sh
